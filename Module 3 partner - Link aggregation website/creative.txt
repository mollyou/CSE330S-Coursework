For our creative portion, we were planning on having a like system in which users could like comments and stories, and also choose to display stories in order of most liked or most recent on the main page. Unfortunately, we ran out of time.
We had changes in theory, but in trying to upload them (must have missed a bracket) we broke the website.

All mysql commands and login credentials are as seen below.
